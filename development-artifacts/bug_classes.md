## Card with spurious keywords field
Cards that grant keywords to other cards (via `grant_keyword` triggered abilities or by summoning creatures with keywords) should not have those keywords in their own `keywords` array, as this causes the keyword to display as a bold header on the card. Applies to both support cards and creatures.
Example: Elixir of Deflection, Wardcrafter, Baron of Tear, General Tullius
How to spot: User reports a keyword showing as a bold header on a card that shouldn't have it. Search for cards with a `keywords` array where the keyword doesn't appear at the start of `rules_text` (e.g. "Guard\n...") but instead appears in a "Give ... Guard/Ward" or "Summon a ... with Guard" phrase.
